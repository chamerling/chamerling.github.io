I am Open Source Architect, Serial Coder at [Linagora](http://linagora.com), a French software editor and professional services provider focused on Open Source Software.
After more than 10 years developping heavy weight Java and Open Source products around Service Oriented Architecture, I am currently having a lot of fun building lightweight and fullstack web oriented solutions in javascript.
