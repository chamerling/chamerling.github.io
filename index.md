I am Open Source Architect, Serial Coder at [Linagora](http://linagora.com), a French software editor and professional services provider focused on Open Source Software.
After more than 10 years developping heavy weight Java and Open Source products around Service Oriented Architecture, I am currently having a lot of fun building lightweight and fullstack web oriented solutions in javascript (be ready to see something completely awesome). I am also having fun with [drones](http://chamerling.github.io/slides/content/rmll14-fr/index.html), trying to not destroy them all.
